# bet-fold

Can we somehow cook up a game where optimum would be bet-fold vs. \*/raise-\*? Or it's not covered in this framework?

In Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker, the strategy is about playing in a way that is unexploitable. This means every action you take must be part of a balanced range that prevents your opponent from gaining an edge, no matter what they do.

So, is a "bet-fold" strategy ever GTO?
Yes — but only in certain spots and with certain hands. Here's how it breaks down:

✅ When bet-fold can be GTO:

In heads-up poker, particularly out-of-position, there are many spots where a GTO strategy includes:

Betting for value or as a semi-bluff.

Folding to a raise if that specific hand is too weak to continue.

This is particularly true on the river or in small pots where you make a thin value bet or blocker bet, and the opponent raises large. GTO allows folding here because:

You’re not supposed to defend everything.

Your betting range must include some weak hands or bluffs that can’t call a raise.
